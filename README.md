# Tachyons + 4K

Fork of tachyons.io with additional media queries for HD (1920x1080) and 4K (3840x2160) displays.

All the Tachyons goodness you know and love, but with a couple of extra breakpoints:


| Screen size | Class extension | Media query                                 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| all       | class-name    |                                             |
| not-small | class-name-ns | (min-width: 30em)                           |
| medium    | class-name-m  | (min-width: 30em) and (max-width: 60em)     |
| large     | class-name-l  | (min-width: 60em) and (max-width: 1920px)   |
| HD        | class-name-hd | (min-width: 1920px) and (max-width: 3840px) |
